bcard is an experimental attempt to make cheap electronic business card on a
thin PCB.  The main goals are for it to be:

    - cheap
    - not gaudy
    - not stupid
    
As awesome as it would be to make the card appear as a USB flash device that
contains my resume, that would be a bit too expensive.  One alternative, is
this design:

But somebody already made it :) Other designs are much more expensive.

My design incorporates a capacitive touch sensor with some blue LEDs around the
corners.  The blue LEDs are actually mounted upside-down so that the card
fluoresces.

Cost of parts is about $1.80 in quantities of 25 (at Digi-Key prices).  At
quantities of 100, the cost per board is $1.54.  The majority of the cost is in
the 4 LEDs and the microcontroller.  You can shave off a few cents by going
with an ATTiny4 instead of an ATTiny10.

IDK, it's cute.
