bcard

bcard is an experimental attempt to make cheap electronic business card on a
thin PCB.  The main goals are for it to be:

    - cheap
    - not gaudy
    - not stupid
    
I originally wanted to make the card a flash drive that would store e.g. my
resume, but I don't think that's possible, but only because it would cost too
much.  Instead, I'll try to do that with a QR code pointing to a website.

IDK, perhaps some kind of cool capacitive thing?
